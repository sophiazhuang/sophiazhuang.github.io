			<div id="song-title">Song Analysis</div>
			<div id="song-subtitle">There are three key areas to look at: instruments, voice, and tone.</div>
			<div class="my-slider">
				<ul>
					<li><div class="instruments"><center><em>Instruments</em></center><br><center>Throughout the piece, there are some light accents in the background by the strings and woodwinds. It moves along with the voice of the singer, not necessarily in conversation with the singer, but in tandem. At times, the strings sharply accent and highlight the singer's words, quickly moving from piano to forte in terms of dynamics.</center></div></li>
					<li><div class="voice"><center><em>Voice</em></center><br><center>The singer adds few embellishments to her singing. Mainly you can only hear the vibrato as her voice moves higher and higher, moving mainly upwards in steps. Her words are indistinguishable, and it sounds like she is only singing vowels.<br><br>After the 3 minute mark, the singer suddenly sings a high-low-high-low portion that is accented by the instrument in the background that rings like a bell, signaling a change in emotion. The singer’s voice heightens in intensity, but then ends in a lower octave, which is very different from the rest of the song.</center></div></li>
					<li><div class="tone"><center><em>Tone</em></center><br><center>The tone and feel of the singer’s voice and the instrumental accompaniment is haunting, almost ethereal. Though the audience cannot understand or follow the text that the singer should be singing, you can tell that she is possibly pleading with the listener. Her melancholy shrieks convey an eerie sense of pain, and her airy voice betrays a feeling of otherworldliness.<br><br>In fact, the original character of Shakespeare’s play is a spirit, not a human. The content also is about death in the form of shipwreck in the deep sea, so the feeling of otherworldliness may also draw from this.</center></div></li>
				</ul>
			</div>

		<div id="musical-elements-container">
			<div id="elements-title">Musical Elements</div>
			<div id="elements-subtitle">I associate this song with elements from Wagner and Modernist music.</div>
			<div id="rectangle-5">
				<div id="elements-subsubtitle"><center>The operatic voice and simplicity of the music are reminiscent of Wagner’s <i>Die Walkure</i> and Modernist music.<br><br>With its similarities to <i>Die Walkure</i>, <i>Five Fathoms Deep</i> had an interesting balance between words and music. Both were light and almost sparingly used, as though to deliver full impact. There were also few recognizable patterns in the instrumental music, which allowed for the sudden accents to have surprising emphasis.<br><br><i>Five Fathoms Deep</i> is like Modernist music because it is surely new and striking: it is a remake of a traditional Shakespearean play. Like many other Modernist songs, such as <i>Rite of Spring</i>, it feels as though the music is hinting at finding something darker within the singer or song content. It is dehumanizing as well, with an inhuman way of singing incoherently.<br><br>Neither of these comparisons are fully perfect, though. With Wagner’s musical style, the vocals strived to have natural rhythms that imitate speech and be easy to understand. The orchestra was also meant to be large, active, and interesting - <i>Five Fathoms Deep</i> lacked these two characteristics. In comparison to Modernist music, this song also does not necessarily deal with industrialism and progress.</center></div>

			<div id="reaction-title">Personal Reaction</div>
			<div id="reaction-subtitle">At first, I didn't know what to make of the song.</div>
			<div id="rectangle-1">
				<div id="reaction-subsubtitle">Initially, I was unimpressed with the music and thought that it lacked meaning because the words were unintelligible. But despite its oddly indistinguishable words, I was drawn to this mysterious interpretation of <i>The Tempest</i>. I have read the original play, and I was shocked at the artistic freedom – almost audacity – of Adès and his libretto to change the words of Shakespeare.</div>
			</div>
			<div id="rectangle-2">
				<div id="reaction-subsubsubtitle">The song has an eerie, beautiful quality to it. Although I couldn’t understand the spoken words, it seemed as though the song was somehow communicating the same emotion and meaning through the mournful musical elements of the singer’s voice and tone and the dramatic and emotional orchestra.</div>
			</div>
			<div id="rectangle-3">
				<div id="reaction-subsubsubsubtitle">I have come to appreciate the song not for what it could plainly provide, which would be very little. But what I do appreciate and enjoy in the piece is the undercurrent of drama and melancholy, which the composer brings precisely by <i>not</i> plainly describing it through extravagant orchestral sounds or trills and embellishments in the singer’s voice. By keeping the song relatively simple, the moments that have more depth and the moments that diverge from the straightforward tune are the moments that convey the appropriate sense of melancholy.</div>
